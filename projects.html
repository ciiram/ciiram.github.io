          <p class="text-justify"> In this project we aim to use audio recordings obtained in the Mt Kenya ecosystem to perform biodiversity assessment, focussing on bird species which serve as an <em>indicator species</em>. Since 2015, we have collected audio recording from the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology conservancy and from the Mt Kenya National Park. Hundreds of recordings have been annotated with information on bird species vocalising within the recordings and we are currently developing machine learning models to automatically identify species found in the Mt Kenya ecosystem.

                Develop, test and deploy IoT systems to gather data that could help mitigate challenges.
              <li>
                Determine appropriate machine learning methodology to use to obtain predictions on food production and storage outcomes based on sensor data.
