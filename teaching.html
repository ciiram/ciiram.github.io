            This course will introduce the student to the fundamentals of signals and systems with emphasis on communication systems. Communications systems have come to play a major role in modern life and a proper understanding of how these systems work requires a good grasp of signals and systems theory. It is hoped that this course will enable the student to pursue further studies in communication and gain confidence in analysing communication systems.

            The speech signal contains significant information. In addition to information about what was said and who said it, we can determine the emotional state of the speaker, and if recording a conversation, we can determine the level of engagement of each of the participants.

Conversational interfaces such as Alexa and Siri allow users to interact with complex systems through voice. These systems show that speech technology is now mature and capable of deployment in real world systems.

This course will introduce the student to the fundamentals of speech processing with a focus on the theory and deployment of real world systems.
